# TODO

1 - Determine how the search path will be given to the script
2 - Will the script check the entire tree or just the given folder?
3 - Which are the methods to be used in order to determine if a file is duplicated or not?
    a - Get MD5 key for the file.
    b - Check for the file size.
4 - How to store the files in order to show them to the user?
